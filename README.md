I'm learning to become a Front End Devoloper. 

This was a course from https://twitter.com/designcoursecom that lasted around 2 hours (thank god for emmet), and it was focused around a crash course on HTML/CSS and a small JS element to it. Loved every bit of building and I'd recommend it to others for sure. 

If you'd like to checkout the tutorial itself. You can find it here: https://youtu.be/D-h8L5hgW-w

Good luck, and happy building XD
